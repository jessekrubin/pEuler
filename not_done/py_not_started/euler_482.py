The incenter of a triangle
http://projecteuler.net/problem=482
ABC is an integer sided triangle with incenter I and perimeter p.
The segments IA, IB and IC have integral length as well.
Let L = p + |IA| + |IB| + |IC|.
Let S(P) = ∑L for all such triangles where p ≤ P. For example, S(103) = 3619.
Find S(107).
