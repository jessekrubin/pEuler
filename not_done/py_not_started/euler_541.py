Divisibility of Harmonic Number Denominators
http://projecteuler.net/problem=541
The nthharmonic number Hn is defined as the sum of the multiplicative inverses of the first n positive integers, and can be written as a reduced fraction an/bn.
H_n = âˆ‘_k=1^n 1/k = a_n/b_n, with gcd(a_n, b_n)=1.
Let M(p) be the largest value of n such that bn is not divisible by p.
For example, M(3) = 68 because H_68 = a_68/b_68 = 14094018321907827923954201611/2933773379069966367528193600, b68=2933773379069966367528193600 is not divisible by 3, but all larger harmonic numbers have denominators divisible by 3.
You are given M(7) = 719102.
Find M(137).
