Friend numbers
http://projecteuler.net/problem=612
Let's call two numbers  friend numbers if their representation in base 10 has at least one common digit. E.g. 1123 and 3981 are friend numbers.
Let f(n) be the number of pairs (p,q) with 1< p  q  n such that p and q are friend numbers.
f(100)=1539.
Find f(10^18) mod 1000267129.
