# pEuler

This is my primarily python project euler problems repository.
I do these problems for fun, and because if I don't do them...then who will?
Functions I regularly use are kept in the lib package file at the root of this repo;
Feel free to check it out and leave either constructive or dispariging criticism (no neutral criticism please).
Last I checked (2018-03-09) i've done 74 problems, and am currently working on 15.
